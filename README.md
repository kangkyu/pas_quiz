1. Write a function that capitalizes every third alphanumeric character in the following string:

Larubymeetup.com
so that your output looks like

laRubYmeEtuP.coM
Notice that, when counting every third character, we ignore the period, but we do include the period in the output.

2. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers that begins with 0, 1. Each subsequent integer is calculated by adding the two integers to the left of it. So the next number in the sequence is 1, because 0 + 1 == 1. The number after that is 2, because 1 + 1 == 2. So, the first several entries in the Fibonacci Sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 …

Write a function that calculates the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

3. Write a program that prints out integers 1-100. If a number is divisible by 3, print the number, followed by a space, followed by “fizz”. If a number is divisible by 5, print the number, followed by a space, followed by “buzz”. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print the number, followed by a space, followed by “fizzbuzz”.

4. Write a program that reverses the string “programming” (not simply “programming’.reverse) :)

5. Given a matrix of integers I draw you on the whiteboard, and one of those integers I choose, as a starting point, write a program that spirals outward counterclockwise, printing the position and value of each integer. When your spiral reaches any edge of the matrix, stop the program.

6. You have a pile of two quarters, and the quarters are identical. With these two quarters, you can make two different kinds of piles; one pile of two, and two piles of one, for a total of two unique partitions.

With three identical quarters, you can make one pile of three quarters, two piles (one with two quarters, the other with one quarter), and three piles of one quarter each, for a total of three unique partitions.

How many unique partitions can you make with four quarters? Try to write a function that calculates the number of unique partitions for four quarters, and for n quarters.
